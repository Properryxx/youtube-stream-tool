## üîç Code Style Guidelines

### Bash Scripting Best Practices

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Quote variables: `"$variable"`
- Use `[[ ]]` for conditions instead of `[ ]`
- Prefer `$()` over backticks for command substitution
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add error checking for critical operations

### Formatting

- Indent with 4 spaces
- Maximum line length of 100 characters
- Use consistent spacing around operators
- Group related functions together

### Comments

- Add comments for complex logic
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Use `#` for single-line comments
- Use clear section headers:

```bash
#==============================================================================
# VIDEO QUALITY SELECTION
#==============================================================================
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Script runs without syntax errors
- [ ] Quality selection interface appears correctly
- [ ] Video playback works with different qualities
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and clear
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms work as expected
- [ ] Script handles invalid URLs gracefully

### Test Cases

1. **Valid YouTube URL** - Should show quality options and play video
2. **Invalid URL** - Should show appropriate error message
3. **Restricted video** - Should handle gracefully with fallbacks
4. **Network issues** - Should timeout appropriately
5. **Missing dependencies** - Should show helpful error messages
